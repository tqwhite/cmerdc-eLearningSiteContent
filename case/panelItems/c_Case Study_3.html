<legend>Mr. Forester Tech Coordinator &#8722; Extraordinaire </legend>
Mr. Forester is a tech coordinator at a mid-sized Minnesota School District. He has opened up opportunities for his staff to become creative with video in their curriculum. Teachers have jumped on the band-wagon and have had great success with this teaching method. But now Mr. Forester is a victim of his own success. He is now dealing with multiple video formats, bandwidth issues, and multiple devices consuming the video. His small video hosting infrastructure is not keeping up with demand and he must find a solution and fast.
