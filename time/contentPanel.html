<h1>Time</h1>
<p class="lead">It takes time to evaluate programs, implement systems, integrate software, train staff, train students, train parents, build buy-in, build online curriculum, monitor, revise, view reports, and analyze success. </p>
<p>Most online or hybrid programs that fail to flourish, fall victim to one or more in the list above.</p>
<p>So you may be asking yourself, how can we successful implement and maintain an online/hybrid program in our school district? Or saying, I&#39;ve already tried this and it didn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>While a piece of software may help you get started, your success is going to depend upon training, support, and a community of other users to help you along the way.</p>
