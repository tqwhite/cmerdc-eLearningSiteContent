						<h3>Building a Digital Curriculum Library with Moodle & Google: A First Look (Session 1)</h3>
						This first of two sessions is a demonstration of one district's approach to designing an integrated, cross-platform curriculum resource management tool that brings curriculum mapping and alignment out of the silo of the PD day and into regular classroom practice. See how our Digital Curriculum Library is used to house resources and assessments, manage learning goals and other elements from the Marzano framework, and provide a planning tool for PLC work without adding "one more thing" for staff to learn. With more of a curriculum focus, attendees will gain a better understanding of how Moodle can work hand-in-hand with existing school systems like Google Apps to provide a vehicle for managing the complex work of school improvement.
